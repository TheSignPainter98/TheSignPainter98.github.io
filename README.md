# Me

I'm a software developer who likes anything technical.
_If something can be automated, it should be._

# Projects

I have worked on a wide range of things over the years, more recently trying to adopt a more open-source approach to my work.

Some notable projects I have worked on include:

- [`emperor`](emperor) a language which attempts to automate the annoyance of threading from the user, while using the speed of C
- [`argspec`](argspec) a JSON format for specifying command-line interfaces
    - [`arggen`](arggen) an argument parser generator which takes an [`argspec`](argspec) json spec
    - [`arglint`](arglint) a linter for [`argspec`](argspec) specs
    - [`mangen`](mangen) a `man` page generator which takes [`argspec`](argspec) specs
    - [`argcompgen`](argcompgen) a bash completion script generator which takes [`argspec`](argspec) specs
- [`texfuck`](texfuck) a [brainfuck](brainfuck) interpreter written in TeX, because.
- A currently-unpublished introductory text to Theoretical Computer Science which has been worked on since mid 2016
- `EATMAC` a computer which executes [brainfuck](brainfuck) as its machine code, created using [logisim](logisim)

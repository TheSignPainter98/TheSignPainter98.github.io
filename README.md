# Me

I'm a software developer who likes anything technical.
_If something can be automated, it should be._

# Projects

I have worked on a wide range of things over the years, more recently trying to adopt a more open-source approach to my work.

Some notable projects I have worked on include:

- [`emperor`](adsf), a language which attempts to automate the annoyance of threading from the user, while using the speed of C
- [`argspec`](), a JSON format
